Here's a summary table of the technologies and commands we discussed related to setting up and using WSL for C/C++ development:

| **Technology/Item**              | **Description**                                               | **Commands/Usage**                                                  |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) | A compatibility layer for running Linux binary executables natively on Windows. | N/A |
| Checking WSL Version             | Determining if you are using WSL 1 or WSL 2.                  | `wsl --list --verbose`                                              |
| Installing GCC/G++ in WSL        | Installing the GNU Compiler Collection for compiling C/C++ programs in Linux. | `sudo apt update`<br>`sudo apt install build-essential` |
| Navigating to Mounted Drives     | Accessing Windows drives (like USB drives) in WSL.            | `cd /mnt/<drive-letter>`<br>Example: `cd /mnt/d`                     |
| Manual Mounting in WSL           | Manually mounting a drive in WSL if itâ€™s not automatically mounted. | `sudo mkdir /mnt/d`<br>`sudo mount -t drvfs D: /mnt/d`               |
| Writing a Mount Script           | Creating a script to mount a drive in WSL.                    | Script example:<br>```#!/bin/bash<br>if [ ! -d "/mnt/d" ]; then<br>    sudo mkdir /mnt/d<br>fi<br>sudo mount -t drvfs D: /mnt/d```<br>Make executable: `chmod +x scriptname.sh` |
| Pasting in Nano Editor           | Pasting copied text into the Nano editor in WSL.              | Use right-click or `Shift + Insert` in the Nano editor.              |
| Updating to WSL 2 (if needed)    | Upgrading an existing WSL 1 installation to WSL 2.            | `wsl --set-default-version 2`<br>`wsl --set-version <DistroName> 2` |

This table covers the key aspects of setting up WSL for C/C++ development, including checking and updating WSL versions, installing necessary compilers, accessing and mounting drives, and basic file editing in WSL using Nano. Remember to replace placeholders like `<drive-letter>` and `<DistroName>` with the actual values relevant to your setup.

This list covers the major tools and resources you would typically use for setting up a C/C++ development environment on a Windows system. Each tool serves a specific purpose, from providing a Unix-like environment (Cygwin) or native Windows build tools (MinGW, Visual Studio Build Tools), to a versatile editor (VS Code) and the ability to run Linux applications on Windows (WSL). Depending on your specific needs and workflow, you may choose to use a combination of these tools.
